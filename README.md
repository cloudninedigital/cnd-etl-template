# Python Project Template for APIs

A repository that serves as a template for deploying small pipelines and 
Cloud Functions in GCP (Google Cloud Platform).

This template uses Python for implementing all the logic deployed in your GCP 
Functions and Terraform as a deployment system.


# How use the ETL template

## 0. Local environment setup
Before starting this flow, please make sure that you have your environment locally setup properly to be able to go through the steps described:

* A functioning WSL (Windows Subsystem Linux) Ubuntu environment
* Pycharm installed and opened through WSL

If you don't have these ready in your system, talk to a senior+ consultant to get this up and running (currently, we don't have a wiki page yet explaining the process). 

## 1. Starting a new repository from this template

> **DO NOT FORK** this is meant to be used from **[Use this template](https://github.com/cloudninedigital/cnd-etl-template/generate)** feature.

1. Click on **[Use this template](https://github.com/cloudninedigital/cnd-etl-template/generate)**
2. Give a name to your project. See [naming conventions](https://github.com/cloudninedigital)
3. Wait until the first run of CI (Continuous Integration) finishes  
   (Github Actions will process the template and commit to your new repo)
4. Then you're ready to advance to step 2. 

## 2. Clone your project

There are multiple ways to clone a project. You can either use your IDE (Pycharm), use a specific GIT tool (like Github Desktop) or
Follow [these instructions](https://wiki.cloudninedigital.nl/en/Processing-and-Delivery/Software-Development/Git/Getting-started-with-Git#cloning-an-existing-repository-from-a-remote-repository) to clone a repository created on Github from command line.

Ultimately, though, once you've cloned the project, you have a local version of the project on your laptop that you can use for further steps.

## 3. Install Terraform, Cloud SDK CLI and GitHub CLI

At Cloud Nine Digital we use Terraform authenticated by Google Cloud credentials to deploy our resources in a GCP.

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an IaC (Infrastructure as Code) tool that allows for reusable and trackable Cloud infrastructure deployments.
For more information about Terraform please visit their [Introduction](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro).

[Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/cli) (Command Line Interface) is a command-line interface that allows for interaction and creation of
Google Cloud resources. In this particular case, we use it to enable authentication of Terraform, and not to create resources through it.

[GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) is a command-line interface that allows for interaction with GitHub repositories. 
In this particular case, we use it to enable authentication of Terraform in our CI/CD pipelines.

Before continuing please take the following steps: 
* [Install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install#deb) and 
[initialize](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing) your Google Cloud CLI. Make sure to authenticate
into the right Google Cloud project ID while initializing. 
* [Install Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/gcp-get-started/install-cli?in=terraform%2Fgcp-get-started). Choose the linux > Ubuntu option for installing, and execute the steps in your WSL ubuntu command line. 
* [Install GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md).

The configuration files for Terraform can be found in the `terraform/` folder.

# 4. Run initialization script
> Note: If you wish to do this manually, please follow the instructions in [manual_init.md](manual_init.md)

Run the following command to initialize your project:
```bash
$ ./helpers/init_project.sh
```
> Note: Should you run into an error message that looks like `env: bash\r: No such file or directory`, this means that you've configured GIT to use Windows line endings, which cannot be interpreted properly by Linux terminals. This will probably only happen if you clone your repository through another tool than the WSL. To fix this, you can execute
```
$ git config --global core.autocrlf false
```
in your command line, remove, and reclone your repository. 

> Note: The script will help you check the status of installation of the necessary tools.
> It will not install them for you, but if they are installed they will be used.
> Furthermore it will check if these tools are properly authenticated, and if not it will help you authenticate them.

The script will prompt you for the following information:
* Your GCP project ID
* Whether you want to enable GitHub CI/CD


## 5 Enable automated deployment on Gitlab or GitHub
> Note: This step is already done for GitHub if you have run the `helpers/init_project.sh` script.
> For Gitlab you will have to do this manually (for now :smile:) 

For Gitlab, the below steps can be followed:
1. Assuming you've executed step 4 properly, you've already created a service account called terraform-agent@<project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com with the proper rights to do a deployment. In the 'Service Accounts' section, go to this service account, and create and download a JSON key file to your local laptop.
2. with a bash shell on your local laptop, do the following to remove line endings from the file:
``` bash
vi gcp-keyfile.json
# press :

# Add the following 
%s;\n; ;g
# Press enter.

# press : again

# Execute the below command to save and close the editor
wq!
```
3a. **If you are using GitLab**, open your repository, go to Settings > CI/CD, expand Variables and create a new
variable with the key GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS, and paste the contents of your changed keyfile as the value.
Make sure all 'flags' (protected, masked and expanded variable) are turned off, you don't need this.
Also make sure that Environment scope stays on 'All'.
3b. **If you are using GitHub**, in your repository, go to **Settings** → **Secrets and Variables** → **Actions** -> New repository secret, and
create a secret named GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS, and paste the contents of your changed keyfile as the value.
4a. **If you are using GitLab**, in your local repository, go to .gitlab-ci.yml and
uncomment the whole script ( CTRL+A and CTRL+/)
4b. **If you are using GitHub**, in your local repository, go to .github/workflows/terraform.yml and uncomment the whole
script ( CTRL+A and CTRL+/)
5. Make sure your variables are all added as intended in prd.tfvars, stg.tfvars and dev.tfvars
6. Push your changes. You will notice that on a separate branch the pipeline will only run until 'terraform plan'.
   The 'terraform apply', and thus the actual deployment will only be done when merging / pushing to the
   'main' or 'development' branches or when a tag is pushed. 

## 6. Start development work

This is where your development journey begins. From here on the steps are highly dependent on the functionality
you are trying to deploy in the cloud. 

There are two main parts to this work:
1. Building your Python code
2. Building your Terraform configuration to deploy that code (as well as additional infrastructure that supports it).

See below for a few more details on both parts:


## 6.1 Terraform configuration

The Terraform configuration is part of the actual infrastructure you will deploy in Google Cloud. Things like Cloud functions, cloud run deployments, service accounts, user rights, pubsub topics and subscriptions and even BigQuery datasets and tables are part of this. 

### using modules
There a few examples of deployments of Cloud Functions present in the folder
`terraform/modules/main_triggers`. From one of these files, you can copy the contents and paste it onto your `terraform/main.tf`.

This will provide you with a starting point for the configuration you are trying to achieve. Please read the documentation of 
each one of these modules before you use them, to avoid surprises in your development process.

Please see more detailed information about the modules in [Terraform templates usage](terraform_usage.md).

### Working with workspaces (staged environments)

Terraform Workspaces are what we use to make sure we can change code in development phases (development, staging, production). A workspace is practically a separate state-file that manages a certain amount of resources, which means that for every development phase, resources are being managed separately. 

Workspaces have different implications for different type of deployments. For most deployments the most important thing is to use the ${terraform.workspace} variable in any kind of application specific name being used, so that terraform knows it should deploy a different version (dev, stg, prd) of a certain resource. In most modules `main_trigger` this is already shown in terms of how you should add the workspace, but be aware that this is a necessary thing, and that Terraform will fail if you forget to deploy resources with a separate name per development stage (because it cannot create the same resource twice in most cases). An example usage of the terraform workspace in a module implementation is below: 

``` terraform
module "cf_http_trigger_bq_processing" {
  source      = "./modules/gf_gen2_http_trigger_source_repo"
  name        = "bigquery_http_function-${terraform.workspace}"
  description = <<EOF
This function will trigger one or multiple bigquery script based upon BigQuery Executor logic
EOF
  project     = var.project
  entry_point = "main_bigquery_http_event"
  environment = {
    PROJECT           = var.project
    GCS_PROJECT       = var.project
    GCS_BUCKET_NAME   = "${var.application_name}-bqexecutor-sync-${terraform.workspace}"
    INCLUDE_VARIABLES = "true"
    SHOW_ALL_ROWS     = "false"
    ON_ERROR_CONTINUE = "false"
    EXCLUDE_TEMP_IDS  = "false"
    ENVIRONMENT        = terraform.workspace
  }
}
```

Specifically for the BigQuery executor, there is more to the story than just incorporating the workspaces names. Here, it is also important to include every table name that you do not wish to touch in a development phase in the configuration json file (this is all perfectly explained in the documentation of the [BigQuery executor](https://github.com/cloudninedigital/cnd-tools/blob/main/cnd_tools/database/bigquery_executor/README.md) ). 

### Shared workspace

For anything that shouldn't be duplicated per development stage, there is the 'shared' workspace. This is a separate folder also in the etl-template (see terraform/shared/) which uses the same state bucket, but has a different workspace in which these resources can be deployed only once. For now, the deployment of shared resources are only done manually. 

Examples of resources that need to be independant of development phases: 
* datasets and tables in BigQuery
* Static IP addresses
* possible things in the future we come up with

For any deployment, you can fill the shared.tfvars file and= use the simple deploy.sh to make sure you deploy through the shared workspace. 

Should you need to use the information from the shared workspace in the normal dev/stg/prd workspaces, you can gather the information with a data block referencing the 'shared' workspace specifically, like in below example: 

``` terraform
data "terraform_remote_state" "gcs" {
  backend = "gcs"
  workspace = "shared"

  config = {
    bucket = "ext_santander_gcp-jostsantanderblx-tfstate"
    prefix = "terraform/state"
  }
}

output "vpc_connector" {
  value = data.terraform_remote_state.gcs.outputs.vpc_connector
}
```

### extended development

To extend your Terraform configuration, you will have to start dwelling into un-templated territory :relaxed:.
Please follow a few [Getting Started with Google Cloud in Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/getting_started)
tutorials to get acquainted with the system.

As a general rule, please not that we try to incorporate as much as possible in re-usable chunks of modules. This means that if you create something that could be reused in another situation, please create / append to a module in Terraform so that a future project can benefit from your work!

## 6.2 Python code
To start development, you will have to understand which service in Google Cloud is your code
going to be deployed. To see how you can start coding your entry points, check the relevant folders:
* For Cloud Functions, please the following entrypoints in `project_name/gcp.py`
  * `main_cloud_event` meant to be used for file events on Google Cloud Storage.
  * `main_http_event` meant to be used for http triggers
  * `main_pubsub` meant to be used for Pub/Sub triggers

In order to configure the triggers for Cloud Functions, please see the section on the [Terraform configuration](#terraform-configuration)
section.

> :exclamation: For now there are not pre-made templates for Cloud Run or other services in Google Cloud. This guide is supposed to be
expanded with more examples as we go forward and explore more Cloud services for ETL/ELT processes.


> **NOTE**: **WAIT** until first CI run on github actions before cloning your new project.


### 5.4 Deploying your code

If you have followed step 5 or ran the `helpers/init_project.sh` script, then your deployments are automated in the following manner:
* Any commits pushed to `main` branch will be deployed to staging environment
* Any tags pushed will be deployed to production environment
* If there is a `development` branch, then any push made to it is deployed to development environment

> **WARNING** Pushing tags to branches other than main might result in unexpected behaviour.
> Please refrain from doing so.

> **WARNING** Pushing tags to commits that are done earlier than previous tags will result in deployment that tag 
> to production environment.
